### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Formerly specialized in video, photo, and graphic content creation ðŸŽ¥, I had the chance to collaborate closely with developers for quite a time. During these years ðŸ“…, I discovered the Web environment and understood all the possibilities it brings to our world. It was then that I realized my interest in web development and decided to make the transition into this field to play my part in shaping the future of the web.

To make this transition, I completed a 5-month intensive bootcamp, where I learned how to use React for frontend development, Express for backend development, and MySQL for database management. I also became proficient in TailwindCSS for building responsive and visually appealing designs. After that, I worked for 16 months as a frontend web developer at a company, where I honed my skills in creating responsive and dynamic web applications.

Currently, Iâ€™m working on a web application for myself to simplify workout tracking, which Iâ€™m also using to improve my development skills.

## Here's my last projects :
