### Hi there 👋

Formerly specialized in video and graphic content creation 🎥, I had the chance to collaborate closely with developers for a very long time.
During all these years 📅, I discovered the Web environment and understood all the possibilities it brings to our world.
And it is by discovering the Web 3 🌐 and understood all the potential that it will be able to bring in the future, that it was obvious to me to reconvert as a Web developer to play my part.

## I chose the languages :
- **Javascript** and **React** for the Frontend.
AND
- **Node** and **Express** for the Backend.

At the same time, I'm studying the functionality of the Blockchain ⚡ and the creation of SmartContract.

## Here's my last projects : 

- A Space Journey **(Hackathon 1st place)** : Development of a web application on the theme of travel.
  - Languages/Framework/Library : React & CSS3. 
  - Repository : https://github.com/o6ris/NoPainNoGain
- Pokebiz **(2nd school Project)** : Development of an e-commerce website on the theme of Pokemons.
  - Languages/Framework/Library : React, Node, Express, Bootstrap, SQL. 
  - Repository : https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/2022-09-JS-RMT-JSCREW-projet2-team2
